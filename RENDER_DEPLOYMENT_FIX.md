# 🚀 RENDER DEPLOYMENT - LATEST FIX

## ❌ Current Problem (Updated)
Your deployment is now progressing further but failing at:
```
> vite build
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

**Root Cause:** `npm ci` only installs production dependencies, but `vite` (build tool) is in devDependencies.

## ✅ The Updated Solution

### 🔧 Fixed Build Script
I've updated your root `package.json` build script from:
```json
"build": "cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build"
```
To:
```json  
"build": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build"
```

This ensures ALL dependencies (including devDependencies like `vite`) are installed.

### 🔧 Correct Build Command for Render
Copy this **EXACT** command to your Render service Build Command:
```bash
npm run build && cd backend && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### 🚀 Start Command (Keep this the same)
```bash
cd backend && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 1 --threads 2 --timeout 120 --worker-class gthread --max-requests 1000 --preload app:app
```

## 🔄 How to Update Your Render Service

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**
2. **Click on your Stock Analyzer service**
3. **Go to Settings**
4. **Update the Build Command to:**
   ```bash
   npm run build && cd backend && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Save Changes**
6. **Redeploy**

## 🧪 Why This Works

- ✅ **Render already has Node.js 24.6.0** (detected from your package.json)
- ✅ **No need to install Node.js** (it's already there)
- ✅ **Your root package.json** has the build script that handles frontend build
- ✅ **Terser dependency** is fixed in frontend/package.json
- ✅ **Python packages** will install from requirements.txt

## 📋 Environment Variables (CRITICAL!)

**You MUST set these in Render Environment tab:**

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/stock_analyzer
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production
NODE_ENV=production
MONGO_DB=stock_analyzer
```

⚠️ **Without MONGODB_URI, your app will crash on startup!**

## 🎯 Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Update Build Command in Render (copy from above)
- [ ] Set MONGODB_URI in Environment Variables
- [ ] Set other environment variables
- [ ] Click "Deploy Latest Commit"
- [ ] Your app should now deploy successfully!

## 🔍 What Changed

| Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|----------------|---------------|
| `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x \| sudo -E bash -` | Removed (Node.js already available) |
| `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs` | Removed (Node.js already available) |
| `cd frontend && npm ci --only=production` | `npm run build` (uses root package.json) |

## 🎉 Expected Result

After this fix, you should see:
```
==> Using Node.js version 24.6.0
==> Running build command 'npm run build && cd backend && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt'...
> stock-analyzer-fullstack@1.0.0 build
> cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
added 300+ packages, and audited packages in 15s
> stock-analyzer-frontend@1.0.0 build  
> vite build
✓ built in 5s
==> Frontend built successfully ✅
==> Installing Python packages...
==> Build completed ✅
==> Starting service...
==> Your service is live! 🎉
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

**You don't need to update anything in Render** - the fix is in your code. Just:

1. **Commit and push** the updated `package.json` to GitHub
2. **Redeploy** in Render (it will use the updated build script)
3. **Set MONGODB_URI** in Environment Variables if not already set

**Copy the corrected build command above and update your Render service now! 🚀**
